If you said, “Checking out Brno, Czech Republic” you’re actually pretty awesome. But most people think Eiffel Tower. The Roman Colosseum. Brandenburg Gate. Paris, Rome and Berlin are pretty nifty places, but why not toss in a few surprisingly charming small European cities that you might not have considered? Not only are they far cheaper than places like Vienna, you can definitely spend a day or two walking around the city. For this list, I’m only including cities that I have personally been to.</p><div class="post__toc"><h3>Table of Contents</h3><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1dj76qs540">Ljubljana, Slovenia</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1dj76s2g61">Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1dj76tcrc2">Kosice, Slovakia</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1dj76ue9q3">Riga, Latvia</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1dj76vfpn4">Gdansk, Poland</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1dj770i6g5">Vilnius, Lithuania</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1dj771j3b6">Lviv, Ukraine</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1dj772lmo7">Zagreb, Croatia</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1dj773m8g8">Tallinn, Estonia</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1dj774ns69">Brest, Belarus</a></li></ul></div><hr><blockquote><h2 id="mcetoc_1dj76qs540"><strong>Ljubljana, Slovenia</strong></h2></blockquote><figure class="post__image--wide"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://nexolist.com/media/posts/16/little-known-european-destinations-worth-visiting-01.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" data-srcset="https://nexolist.com/media/posts/16/responsive/little-known-european-destinations-worth-visiting-01-xs.jpg 300w ,https://nexolist.com/media/posts/16/responsive/little-known-european-destinations-worth-visiting-01-sm.jpg 480w ,https://nexolist.com/media/posts/16/responsive/little-known-european-destinations-worth-visiting-01-md.jpg 768w" alt="A city that nobody can pronounce.
