But it doesn’t involve skating, hockey sticks or pucks. Instead, you push a heavy, polished disk of granite forward while your teammates frantically sweeping the ice in a desperate attempt to clean it as quickly as possible. Because nobody wants to walk around on dirty sheets of ice, right? And then something dumb happens or whatever and everybody cheers. Congratulations! You have just given birth to curling! Personally, I’m all for pointless sports that take a lot of skill and training and which result in an Olympic medal at best, but in 99% of cases a firm handshake for your efforts. In fact, here are a few more weird sports that should merit Winter Olympic consideration.</p><div class="post__toc"><h3>Table of Contents</h3><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1dj6lhivu1">Snow Kiting</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1dj6ljcgh2">Dog Sled Racing </a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1dj6lkn0o3">Ice Karting</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1dj6lm7jp4">Broomball</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1dj6lns0s5">Snow Kayaking</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1dj6lp63d6">Ski ballet</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1dj6lqnkq7">Snow Polo</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1dj6lrvko8">Ice Climbing</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1dj6lt85n9">Skijoring</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1dj6lufoia">Polar Bear Swimming</a></li></ul></div><hr><blockquote><h2 id="mcetoc_1dj6lhivu1"><strong>Snow Kiting</strong></h2></blockquote><figure class="post__image--wide"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://nexolist.com/media/posts/10/winters-sports-01.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" data-srcset="https://nexolist.com/media/posts/10/responsive/winters-sports-01-xs.jpg 300w ,https://nexolist.com/media/posts/10/responsive/winters-sports-01-sm.jpg 480w ,https://nexolist.com/media/posts/10/responsive/winters-sports-01-md.jpg 768w" alt="Picture water-based kiteboarding.
